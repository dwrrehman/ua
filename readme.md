# The Universe Algorithm.

a codebase for doing experiments and related coding tasks, with the goal of finding the universe algorithm (ua). This code is a work in progress, and isn't meant to be useful outside of doing ad-hoc experiments for finding the ua.

right now, i am attempting to do a symbolic m ary search, and look for cas which recreate rule 110, where m = 2, and n = 1, (where m is the modulus, and n is the dimension.)

im going to try to edit this in sublime.
