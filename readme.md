# The Universe Algorithm theory's codebase.

This is a codebase for a command line utility for doing experiments and related coding tasks, with the goal of finding the universe algorithm (ua). This code is a work in progress, and isn't exactly useful outside of doing ad-hoc experiments for finding the ua.

the three ua cases which are being searched for right now, are the m=3,n=3 case, the m=2,n=4 case, and the m=2,n=5 case.  thus alot of code pertains specifcally to them, but i try to work for the general m,n case if i can.

typical things this utility can do, include performing math operations, like reduce and unreduce, converting expression, doing h grid search and visualization, and reading and writing parameter, hgrid, and z value files, produced from searching. more functions are still being added, to make the system more useful.

even though its just for me, you might find this interesting as well. enjoy!
