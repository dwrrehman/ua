# The Universe Algorithm.

This is a codebase for doing experiments and related coding tasks, with the goal of finding the universe algorithm (ua). This code is a work in progress, and isn't exactly useful outside of doing ad-hoc experiments for finding the ua.

the two ua cases which are being searched for right now, are the 3,1 case,  and the 2,2 case. (sb, s, ss)

in addition to searching for these CAs, the code can also visualize CAs, or a single CA, either by a set of z values, a single z value, or an h grid. these are done by the visualize commands: hg, z, v.

the system has a set of parameters which are manipulated with the set and get commands (set and get)
