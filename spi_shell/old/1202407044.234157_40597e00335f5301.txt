trying to figure out how to output gpio pin states from the riscv computer cpu, to by pass the pcie controller!

commands that are used in order to probe gpio pins on the riscv computer:



	first, you must export the gpio pin, to make it accessible:


		sudo -i      // become root first. 


		echo 447 > /sys/class/gpio/export       // exporting gpio pin 447 for example. 



	setting the pin to high or low:

		cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio447/direction

		echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio447/direction

		echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio447/value

		echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio447/value



	reading the value of the pin:


		echo in > /sys/class/gpio/gpio447/direction

		cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio447/value
		




	when you are done with it, please unexport the pin:


		echo 447 > /sys/class/gpio/unexport






thats it, i think. 

yay
