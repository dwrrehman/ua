/**
 maps a set of search(unknown) values into the h grid,
 in the right positions.
 
 indicies are a vector of indicies
 (ie, rule numbers, with the dimensional neighborhood ordering)
 of the h grid cases, which have "unknown" for their output.
 
 h is the output. search is the input vector, which is the current try
 (ie, an unreduce of z in Z)
 for rules which are unknown.
 this function simply maps the vlaues in that
 search array to the correct hgrid positions,
 by going through each index in indicies,
 and putting it where it needs to go.
 
 super wordy explanation.
